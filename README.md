Travel Planner App
Welcome to the Travel Planner App! This application has been built on Bubble and integrates OPEN-AI API using Microsoft Azure Function. It aims to simplify the travel planning process by generating personalized travel plans based on user inputs.

Introduction

The Travel Planner App combines the power of Chat-GPT and DALL-E, a natural language processing model and an Image generation model, with the functionality of Bubble, a no-code platform. By leveraging the Microsoft Azure Function, **the app collects user inputs, including the travel location, interests, and the number of tour days. It then utilizes the Chat-GPT API to engage in a conversation with the user, refining their preferences and gathering additional details.**
